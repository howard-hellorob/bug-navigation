LOOP until Goal Reached:
    1. READ Odometry (x, y, theta)
    2. READ Lidar (ranges, angles)
    
    3. CALCULATE Angle_To_Goal
    4. SENSOR CHECK:
       Find minimum Lidar distance inside a 60-degree slice 
       centered on Angle_To_Goal.
    
    5. STATE MACHINE UPDATE:
       IF State is GO_TO_GOAL:
          IF Goal_Distance < Tolerance:
             STOP (Success)
          ELSE IF Slice_Distance < 0.5 meters:
             Switch State to WALL_FOLLOW
             
       IF State is WALL_FOLLOW:
          IF Slice_Distance > 0.7 meters:
             Switch State to GO_TO_GOAL
             
    6. EXECUTE MOTOR COMMANDS:
       IF State is GO_TO_GOAL:
          Drive using Proportional Controller on Distance and Angle errors.
       IF State is WALL_FOLLOW:
          Drive using Cross-Product Wall Follower (maintain 0.3m distance).
